// Incremental sentence splitter for voice-live TTS. `SentenceChunker.push`
// is fed the FULL accumulated assistant text on every streaming update (not
// a delta) and returns only the newly-completed sentences since the last
// call, so the TTS queue can start speaking a sentence the instant it's
// finished without waiting for the whole turn.
//
// Fenced code blocks are never spoken verbatim: a chunker holds the block
// back entirely and, once it closes, emits a single short spoken note in its
// place (the note text is caller-supplied so it can be localized).
